## 📖 Overview

**FrontLine Framework** is a cooperative PvE scenario for Arma Reforger built on the base Everon map. Players work together against an AI-controlled enemy force in a frontline-style conflict where territory control, supply logistics, and base fortification determine the outcome of the battle.

This repository serves as the **official documentation and progress tracking hub** for the mod's development.

## 🎯 Objective
